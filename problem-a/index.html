    <h1> Hobbes the Tiger</h1>

    <p>This is <a href="https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Hobbes">Hobbes the Tiger</a>, one of the main characters
        from the comic strip <cite>Calvin and Hobbes</cite>.
        He is the best friend of Calvin, a six-year-old boy with a wild imagination. To everyone else, Hobbes is simply
        a stuffed animal, but to Calvin, Hobbes is a real tiger with thoughts, emotions, and an unsatiable desire for
        tuna.</p>
    <h2> 3 Reasons Why I Admire Hobbes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The character of Hobbes serves as a counter to Calvin's naivet√© and often negative perspective on the world.
            It is important to see both the good and bad in the world, and I admire Hobbes' mentality and viewpoints.
        </li>
        <li class="highlight">Although Hobbes is often wrong about many things (especially when it comes to basic math),
            he acts as a
            mentor for Calvin and helps him guide through life.</li>
        <li>Hobbes is kind and very loyal to Calvin, and his perspective of "taking the time to cherish the precious
            things" is something that reasonates with me.
